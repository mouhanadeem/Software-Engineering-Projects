Projects in Java and .Net

Decryption:
I first three semester I got a good command on programming as most of the courses are on Java and project management.

First semester was started with simple programming and it was my first experience with coding. So main parts of that course were inheritance, polymorphism, abstract and interfaces. On the base of that knowledge we have to develop a project on Event management system. The project was in group and we perform very good by getting high marks. 

In second semester we have studied more advance level programming in java. We have dealt with Socket and RMI for connections. And to make code understandable and independent we got the knowledge on design patterns for example, Visitor, factory, adopter, proxy, observable, facade etc. The project we have decided to work on was Client Management system. We have studied PostgreSQL for database and implemented in our project for storing informationâ€™s. In that project we got the highest grade and a better learning. Most of the coding part me and one of my group mates implemented. 

The third semester started with heterogeneous programming knowledge i.e. advanced java and .NET. We have studied how to work with three tier architecture and distributed system. We have got the experience on webservices in both languages. Cinema Movie management system we are working on. We have decided that our system should be in .Net and webservices in java. We are still working on project but most of the part is completed as Webservices are implemented and client is working. Only the connection is remaining. 

I hope you will enjoy my coding style.
