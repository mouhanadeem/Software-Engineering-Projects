Projects in Java and .Net

Decryption:

In first three semesters I got a good command on programming as most of the courses were on Java and project management.

Movie World Management System

Third semester was started with heterogeneous programming knowledge i.e. advanced java and .NET. The purpose of this project was to develop a system by which customers are able to stream movies and book tickets for a specific cinema online. Movie World System (MWS) is a desktop application created for streaming movies, viewing their description and relevant information including trailers, plus it provides the customer with a service to buy a ticket for movies.
MWS has to be implemented on the three tier Architecture basis and designed as a heterogeneous system. It has a user friendly Graphical Interface designed and developed using .Net Framework Form for the first tier (T1). The Second tier consist of business logic, web services and external Rest API (PayPal) and it is implemented in java (T2) by Spring Boot Framework. DAO (Data access object) with model entities are presented in the data tier (T3) and Hibernate is used for mapping. To store the entities “MSQL Azure” is used. 

Clinical Management System

In second semester I have studied more advance level programming in java.  The proposed system (Clinical Management System) is a computerized system that saves patient records. It will reduce the burden related to the daily responsibilities of Doctors and Nurses. The system has integrated functionality for retrieving staff and patient records, appointments, prescription, medical cases and medicine. The reason behind the project was to make a System that would be implemented in a Client/ Server type of program. For this reason, RMI (Remote Method Invocation) was used. All the information passed through the application should be saved on a database (postgreSql) using a server, and all of the passed information could be read and wrote by any user (in this project: manager, doctor, nurses). Working on this project I got a rigrious knowledge on design patterns for example, Visitor, factory, adopter, proxy, observable, facade, flyweight etc. In that project we got the highest grade and a better learning. Most of the coding part me and one of my group mates implemented. 

Event Management System

First semester was started with simple programming and it was my first experience with coding. So main parts of that course were inheritance, polymorphism, abstract and interfaces. On the base of that knowledge we have to develop a project on Event management system. The purpose of an Event Management System is to store and act upon stored information so that events can be more easily managed without the use of a paper filing system. Many other Management Systems exist on the market for a variety of different purposes.
The main goal of the project is to create a system in Java to manage events for Vipassana Insight Awareness, so that a user can manage information in regards to events, lecturers and members. Managing each of these categories should allow the user to add, remove and edit them, as well as the ability to attach lecturers and members to each event in order to properly organise a list of attendees.The project was in group and we perform very good by getting good marks. 




I hope you will enjoy my coding style.
