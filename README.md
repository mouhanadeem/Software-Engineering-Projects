Projects in Java and .Net

Decryption:

In first three semesters I got a good command on programming as most of the courses were on Java and project management.

Movie World Management System

Third semester was started with heterogeneous programming knowledge i.e. advanced java and .NET. The purpose of this project was to develop a system by which customers are able to stream movies and book tickets for a specific cinema online. Movie World System (MWS) is a desktop application created for streaming movies, viewing their description and relevant information including trailers, plus it provides the customer with a service to buy a ticket for movies.
MWS has to be implemented on the three tier Architecture basis and designed as a heterogeneous system. It has a user friendly Graphical Interface designed and developed using .Net Framework Form for the first tier (T1). The Second tier consist of business logic, web services and external Rest API (PayPal) and it is implemented in java (T2) by Spring Boot Framework. DAO (Data access object) with model entities are presented in the data tier (T3) and Hibernate is used for mapping. To store the entities “MSQL Azure” is used. 

In second semester I have studied more advance level programming in java. I have dealt with Socket and RMI for connection between client and server. I also got the knowledge on design patterns for example, Visitor, factory, adopter, proxy, observable, facade, flyweight etc. The project we have decided to work on was Client Management system. We have studied PostgreSQL for database and implemented in our project for storing information’s. In that project we got the highest grade and a better learning. Most of the coding part me and one of my group mates implemented. 


First semester was started with simple programming and it was my first experience with coding. So main parts of that course were inheritance, polymorphism, abstract and interfaces. On the base of that knowledge we have to develop a project on Event management system. The project was in group and we perform very good by getting good marks. 




I hope you will enjoy my coding style.
